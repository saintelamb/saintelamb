<h6 align="center"> I'm shy in a mystical kind of way, like a ghost, but always glad to connect with other souls. I just wish to share a little bit of love with everyone.
<h6 align="center">I don't mind if you vent to me, whatever the topic is. I am by now means a professional and you should always try to seek help from a professional if needed and if you have the possibility to do so, but I'm good at listening and willing to offer emotional support as much as I can.	
<h6 align="center">I’m an artist who enjoys writing, singing and acting. I am a little distant and shy when it comes to my art – especially writing – but I’m always glad to share this passion with others! I am a huge bookworm, and although I especially read horror-related books, I am more than happy to share and discover more! I can get very inspired and eager when the topic revolves around literature and cinema, feel free to talk to me if you're interested. <3

<h5 align="center">DNI if...</h>
<h6 align="center">I don’t have much boundaries except if you don’t respect the basic DNI criteria, which includes any kind of discrimination towards anyone – basic DNI criteria also includes anything criminal, of course.

I abhor unfairness, ableism, mischief and vulgarity; meanness does not make one superior, I believe it’s quite pitiful and idiotic to act smug about your inability to respect others’ boundaries and wellbeing. As much as I'm able to understand that someone might act in a hostile manner for personal reasons, that shouldn't justify, in my opinion, their excruciating behavior.

NSFW topics most of the time repulse me, please do not engage in such conversations with me. I am very affectionate and tender with people and I have no trouble expressing my affection and sympathy, but flirting, even as a joke, makes me very uncomfortable– I have a very soft and weak heart.

If you are a true crime enjoyer and consider it as a “funny entertainment” or glorify murderers and serial killers, please keep your distance from me as well. This is not entertaining and this is not cute to say “Hihi I love falling asleep while listening to true crime podcasts♥”... The suffering of people, their grief and their difficulty in dealing with the loss of their loved ones, is not something to be entertained. The atrocity of the crimes committed is not something to be glorified.

Needless to say, if you are into real footages depicting death or anything harmful towards humans and animals, please stay away from me.
